    "## 134. Gas Station\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Description\n",
    "There are `n` gas stations arranged in a circle. You are given two integer arrays:\n",
    "- `gas[i]`: amount of gas available at station `i`\n",
    "- `cost[i]`: gas required to travel from station `i` to `i + 1` (with wraparound)\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with an empty tank at any station and can refuel fully. Return the **starting gas station index** from which you can complete the circuit **exactly once**, or `-1` if it‚Äôs impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Approach\n",
    "This is a **greedy problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, **check feasibility**:\n",
    "   - If `total gas < total cost`, no solution exists ‚Üí return `-1`.\n",
    "2. Iterate through each station while tracking:\n",
    "   - `current_tank`: net gas in your tank\n",
    "   - `start`: candidate starting station\n",
    "3. If at any station `current_tank` drops below `0`, reset:\n",
    "   - That means you cannot reach station `i+1` from the current start.\n",
    "   - So, the next station becomes the new start.\n",
    "4. If total gas is enough and you find such a start index, it‚Äôs **guaranteed to work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Greedy Reset Rule**:\n",
    "  - Restart from the next station whenever tank goes negative.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Guarantee**:\n",
    "  - If total gas ‚â• total cost, a solution always exists.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1)\n",
    "\n",

    "### üîç Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Start at station 3:\n",
    "- tank = 0 ‚Üí +4 (gas[3]) ‚Üí -1 (cost[3]) ‚Üí tank = 3\n",
    "- station 4: +5 - 2 = 6\n",
    "- station 0: +1 - 3 = 4\n",
    "- station 1: +2 - 4 = 2\n",
    "- station 2: +3 - 5 = 0 ‚Üí completed!\n",
