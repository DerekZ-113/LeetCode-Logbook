    "## 846. Hand of Straights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Description\n",
    "Alice has a hand of `hand.length` cards, each represented by an integer. She wants to group the cards into sets of **groupSize** consecutive cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if she can rearrange the hand to form such groups, or `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group must contain exactly `groupSize` cards, and the cards within each group must be **consecutive** integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Approach\n",
    "Use a **min-heap** to repeatedly form groups starting from the smallest available card:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quick check**: If `len(hand) % groupSize != 0`, we can't split them evenly — return `False`.\n",
    "2. **Count frequencies** using a `Counter`.\n",
    "3. **Heapify the keys** (unique numbers) to always get the smallest available card.\n",
    "4. While the heap is not empty:\n",
    "   - Take the smallest number `first`.\n",
    "   - Try to form a group of `groupSize` starting from `first`.\n",
    "   - For each number `i` in that group:\n",
    "     - If it's not in `count`, return `False`.\n",
    "     - Subtract 1 from its count.\n",
    "     - If count becomes 0:\n",
    "       - It **must** be the current heap root (`heap[0]`) to maintain heap consistency — otherwise return `False`.\n",
    "       - If it is, pop it from the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Heap for ordered processing**:\n",
    "  - Ensures we always build groups starting with the lowest available number.\n",
    "- **Greedy strategy**:\n",
    "  - Form each group as soon as possible from the current smallest number.\n",
    "- **Edge Validation**:\n",
    "  - Enforce that numbers removed from the count must also be removed from the heap if depleted.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)  \n",
    "  - Because of heap operations and group formation.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n)\n",
