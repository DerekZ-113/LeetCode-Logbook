    "### 🧗‍♂️ 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs — Description & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given an array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of stepping on the `i-th` stair.  \n",
    "You can start at either step 0 or step 1. You can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.  \n",
    "The goal is to reach the **\"top floor\"**, which is *just past the last index*, at **minimum total cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Dynamic Programming** with a space-optimized solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let `prev2` represent the min cost to reach two steps back.\n",
    "- Let `prev1` represent the min cost to reach one step back.\n",
    "- At each step `i`, we compute the min cost to reach step `i`:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  current = min(prev1 + cost[i - 1], prev2 + cost[i - 2])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We roll the values forward using:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  prev2, prev1 = prev1, current\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The loop runs from `2` to `n` (inclusive), because we want the cost to step **off** the last stair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔚 Return\n",
    "We return `prev1` which will represent the min cost to reach the top of the floor."
