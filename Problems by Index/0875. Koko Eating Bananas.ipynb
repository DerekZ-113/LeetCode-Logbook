    "## 🐵 Leetcode 875: Koko Eating Bananas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, where `piles[i]` represents the number of bananas in the `i`-th pile. Each hour, she chooses one pile and eats up to `k` bananas from it. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them and won’t return to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko wants to eat all the bananas within `h` hours. Return the **minimum eating speed `k`** (an integer) that allows her to finish all the bananas in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Approach: Binary Search on the Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t search through the `piles` array — we search for the minimum possible value of `k`, the number of bananas Koko eats per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Space**:\n",
    "   - Minimum speed = `1` (slowest possible)\n",
    "   - Maximum speed = `max(piles)` (fastest — eat entire pile in 1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Helper Idea**:\n",
    "   - For a given `k`, compute how many hours it takes to eat all bananas using `ceil(pile / k)` for each pile.\n",
    "   - If total hours is **more than `h`**, then `k` is too slow → try a higher `k`.\n",
    "   - If total hours is **less than or equal to `h`**, then `k` might be valid → try to find a smaller valid `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Search Logic**:\n",
    "   - Move `left` and `right` pointers based on whether Koko can finish on time.\n",
    "   - Keep track of the smallest valid `k` encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Ceiling Division**:\n",
    "   - Instead of `math.ceil(pile / k)`, use integer math: `(pile + k - 1) // k`"

    "### 🧠 2. **Key Concepts Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ When to Use Binary Search on the Answer\n",
    "- You're not searching in a sorted array.\n",
    "- You're searching for the **smallest or largest value** that satisfies a condition.\n",
    "- The condition must be **monotonic** — i.e., once it's true, it stays true (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Problem Core\n",
    "- Input: `piles` of bananas, total allowed hours `h`.\n",
    "- Goal: Find the **minimum speed `k`** such that Koko can eat all the bananas in `h` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Simulation Logic\n",
    "- For a given speed `k`, time to eat one pile:  \n",
    "  `ceil(pile / k)` = `(pile + k - 1) // k`\n",
    "- Sum over all piles to get `total_hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Binary Search Process\n",
    "- **Start range**: `left = 1`, `right = max(piles)`\n",
    "- On each iteration:\n",
    "  - Compute mid-point `mid = (left + right) // 2`\n",
    "  - Check if total eating time with speed `mid` is within `h` hours\n",
    "    - If **too long**: move `left = mid + 1`\n",
    "    - If **within limit**: store `mid` as a possible result, try smaller → `right = mid - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Edge Considerations\n",
    "- Speed must be at least `1` (Koko can't eat 0 bananas/hour)\n",
    "- Speed can never be more than `max(piles)` (eating faster than the biggest pile in one hour is useless)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧯 Time Complexity\n",
    "- `O(n * log m)` where:\n",
    "  - `n` is the number of piles\n",
    "  - `m` is the range between 1 and `max(piles)`"
