    "### 🧠 Problem: Can Attend All Meetings\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a list of meeting time intervals, each defined as a list `[start, end]`. Return `True` if a person can attend all meetings — that is, **no two intervals overlap**. Otherwise, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the intervals by end time** using a lambda function:  \n",
    "   `intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda i: i[1])`  \n",
    "   This tells Python to compare each interval based on its end time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop through adjacent pairs** and compare:\n",
    "   - `intervals[i][1]` → the end time of the current meeting  \n",
    "   - `intervals[i+1][0]` → the start time of the next meeting  \n",
    "   If the current meeting ends **after** the next one starts, there's an overlap — return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the loop finishes without finding overlap, return `True`."

    "### 🧩 Key Concept Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lambda Function**: `lambda i: i[1]` creates a tiny, temporary function that pulls out the second element of each interval — that’s the `end` time. Python passes each sublist like `[start, end]` into `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Sort by End Time**: Sorting first ensures we're only comparing each meeting to the one right after it. This keeps the check simple and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlap Check Logic**: If the current meeting’s end time is greater than the next meeting’s start time, they clash.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge Case**: An empty `intervals` list returns `True` because there’s nothing to conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting  \n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if done in-place (or O(n) if you count the new sorted list)"
