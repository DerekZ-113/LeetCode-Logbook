    "## 621. Task Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Description\n",
    "Given a list of CPU tasks represented by capital letters `A` to `Z`, and a non-negative integer `n` representing the **cooldown** period between two same tasks, return the **least number of time units** the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same task **must be separated** by at least `n` units of time. During that cooldown, the CPU can either run other tasks or stay idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Approach\n",
    "- Use a **max heap** to always choose the task with the highest remaining frequency.\n",
    "- Use a **queue** to track tasks that are currently in the cooldown period. Each item in the queue is a tuple `(ready_time, -count)`.\n",
    "- At each time unit:\n",
    "  - Increment the current time.\n",
    "  - If a task in the cooldown queue becomes available (`ready_time == current time`), reinsert it into the heap.\n",
    "  - If the heap is not empty, run the task with the highest remaining frequency.\n",
    "  - If the task still has remaining runs, push it into cooldown with the correct future `ready_time`.\n",
    "- Continue until both the heap and the cooldown queue are empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Max Heap Simulation**:\n",
    "  - Python’s `heapq` is a min heap, so we store negative frequencies to simulate a max heap.\n",
    "- **Cooldown Tracking**:\n",
    "  - A `deque` is used to track when tasks can be pushed back into the heap.\n",
    "- **Idle Time**:\n",
    "  - If no task is ready and the heap is empty, time still moves forward (implicitly accounts for idle periods).\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - O(n log n), where n is the number of tasks — due to heap operations and queue handling.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - O(26) for task types + O(n) for cooldown tracking.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🔍 Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B\n",
