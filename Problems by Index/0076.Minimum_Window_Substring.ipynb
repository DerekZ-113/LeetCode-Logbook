    "### 🔍 76 Minimum Window Substring\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which contains all the characters from `t`. If no such window exists, return the empty string `\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned window must have **all characters from `t` with correct frequency** — not just a subset or in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic **sliding window** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Track character frequency** of `t` using a `need` hash map.\n",
    "2. Slide a window using two pointers `left` and `right`:\n",
    "   - Expand the window by moving `right`\n",
    "   - When all required characters are present in the window, **contract** from the left to minimize\n",
    "3. Use a `valid` counter to track how many characters in the window match the required counts.\n",
    "4. Keep updating the best (shortest) valid window as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Time & Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time:** O(n) — each character is visited at most twice (once by `right`, once by `left`)\n",
    "- **Space:** O(k) — where `k` is the number of unique characters in `t`"
