    "**Problem**:  \n",
    "Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range `[left, right]`, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:  \n",
    "We observe that the bitwise AND across a range zeroes out all the *changing* bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shift both `left` and `right` to the right **until they are equal**. This removes all differing lower bits.\n",
    "2. Count how many times we shift — this is how many bits we need to append back as zeroes.\n",
    "3. Left-shift the final common prefix back to restore the original bit-length.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we isolate the **common bit prefix**, which is the only part that survives bitwise AND."

    "\n",
    "- **Bitwise AND Behavior**: Any bit that changes in the range will be zeroed out.\n",
    "- **Common Prefix**: We keep shifting until `left == right` — meaning we found the common prefix.\n",
    "- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Removes the least significant bit.\n",
    "- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Restores bit position after trimming.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` — at most 32 shifts for 32-bit integers.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — only a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clever use of binary properties. It’s one of those elegant “binary trick” problems where understanding the underlying bit pattern gives you a powerful shortcut."
