    "\n",
    "You are asked to implement a class `StockSpanner` that calculates the \"stock span\" for each daily stock price.  \n",
    "The span of a stock's price today is the number of consecutive days (including today) the price has been **less than or equal to** today's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§  Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to store pairs of `(price, span)`. For each new `price`, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with `span = 1` (current day).\n",
    "- While the top of the stack has a price **less than or equal** to today's price:\n",
    "  - Pop the stack and **add its span** to the current span.\n",
    "- Push the current `(price, span)` back to the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we skip over all the previous prices that don't block today's span.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures **amortized O(1)** time per operation by collapsing consecutive lower-or-equal prices into a single entry."

    "### ðŸ“š Key Concepts Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monotonic Stack**:\n",
    "  - Maintains a strictly decreasing order of prices.\n",
    "  - Pops previous prices that are <= the current price to accumulate the span.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Span Calculation**:\n",
    "  - Span includes the number of consecutive previous days with prices <= today.\n",
    "  - Equal prices are included, so we must use `>=` in comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Use a Stack**:\n",
    "  - Efficient tracking of previous prices.\n",
    "  - Avoids rechecking every price in brute-force fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Each price is pushed and popped at most once â†’ amortized **O(1)** per `next()` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic **online algorithm** problem with a real-world data stream feel."
