    "**Problem**:  \n",
    "You run a lemonade stand and each lemonade costs $5. Customers pay with either \\$5, \\$10, or \\$20 bills. Given an array `bills` representing the sequence of bills paid by customers, return `True` if you can provide the correct change to every customer; otherwise, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:  \n",
    "Use a greedy simulation with two counters:\n",
    "- `five` to track number of \\$5 bills.\n",
    "- `ten` to track number of \\$10 bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each bill:\n",
    "- If it's \\$5: Just take it (no change needed).\n",
    "- If it's \\$10: Give back a \\$5 if you have it.\n",
    "- If it's \\$20: Prefer to give change as one \\$10 and one \\$5 (if possible). If not, try giving three \\$5s. If neither is possible, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This greedy method always prioritizes larger bills for change to preserve smaller ones for future transactions."

    "- **Greedy Strategy**: Always try to give larger denominations as change first.\n",
    "- **Inventory Simulation**: Track how many \\$5 and \\$10 bills you have at any point.\n",
    "- **Failure Condition**: Return `False` immediately when exact change can't be given.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` — we iterate through the list once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — only two counters are used regardless of input size.\n",

    "This is a classic greedy exchange problem — simulate the real-life process carefully and greedily preserve smaller bills."
