    "### ðŸª™ 322. Coin Change â€” Problem Description & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "You are given an integer array `coins` representing coin denominations, and an integer `amount`.  \n",
    "Return the *minimum number of coins* needed to make up that amount.  \n",
    "If that amount cannot be made up, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may use each coin denomination as many times as you like.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§  Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”½ Bottom-Up DP\n",
    "- Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the **minimum number of coins** to make amount `i`.\n",
    "- Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (base case), and the rest as infinity.\n",
    "- For each coin and each amount â‰¥ coin, update `dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount - coin] + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¼ Top-Down DP with Memoization (`@lru_cache`)\n",
    "- Define a recursive function `dfs(remaining)` that returns the minimum coins to make `remaining`.\n",
    "- Try each coin and recurse on `remaining - coin`.\n",
    "- Use `@lru_cache` to cache results and avoid recomputation.\n",
    "- Return `inf` if an amount is unreachable, and convert it to `-1` at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- Time: O(amount * n) n is the types of coins\n",
    "- Space: O(amount)"
