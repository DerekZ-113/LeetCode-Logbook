    "\n",
    "You're given an encoded string where the encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`. The `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is repeated exactly `k` times. Your goal is to return the decoded version of the string.\n",

    "Use a **stack** to simulate decoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traverse the string character by character.\n",
    "- If the character is not `]`, push it to the stack.\n",
    "- When you hit `]`, it signals the end of a pattern:\n",
    "  1. Pop characters until `'['` to get the encoded substring.\n",
    "  2. Pop digits before the `'['` to get the multiplier.\n",
    "  3. Multiply the substring and push the result back on the stack.\n",
    "- At the end, join everything in the stack to form the final string.\n",
    "\n",
    "This handles **nested encodings** naturally by decoding innermost brackets first."
