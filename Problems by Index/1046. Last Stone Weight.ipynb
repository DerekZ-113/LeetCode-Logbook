    "### 1046. Last Stone Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Description\n",
    "You are given a list of stones with positive integer weights. Each turn, take the two heaviest stones and smash them together:\n",
    "- If the stones are equal, both are destroyed.\n",
    "- If they are unequal, the smaller one is destroyed and the larger one is reduced by the smaller's weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat this process until there is at most one stone left. Return the weight of the last remaining stone, or `0` if all stones are destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Approach\n",
    "- Since we need to repeatedly extract the heaviest stones, a **max heap** is ideal.\n",
    "- Python's `heapq` module only supports a **min heap**, so we store the negative of each stone weight to simulate a max heap.\n",
    "- Convert the list to a heap using `heapq.heapify`.\n",
    "- While more than one stone remains:\n",
    "  - Pop the two heaviest stones.\n",
    "  - If they are not equal, push the result of the smash back into the heap.\n",
    "- Return the remaining stone (converted back to positive), or `0` if none remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Heap (Priority Queue)**:\n",
    "  - Python's `heapq` provides a min heap. Using negation (`-x`) converts it into a max heap.\n",
    "- **Greedy Approach**:\n",
    "  - Always pick the two heaviest stones to minimize leftover mass.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Building heap: O(n)\n",
    "  - Each pop/push operation: O(log n), repeated up to n times.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - O(n) for storing the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Smash 7 and 8 → Push 1\n",
    "# Smash 4 and 2 → Push 2\n",
    "# Smash 2 and 1 → Push 1\n",
    "# Smash 1 and 1 → Both gone\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 1"
