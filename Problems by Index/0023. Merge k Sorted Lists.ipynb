    "## 23. Merge k Sorted Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Description\n",
    "You are given an array of `k` linked lists, each of which is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked lists into one **sorted** linked list and return its head.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Approach\n",
    "Use a **min-heap (priority queue)** to efficiently retrieve the smallest node among the heads of the remaining lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the `ListNode` class by defining a custom `__lt__` method so nodes can be compared based on `val`.\n",
    "2. Push the **head of each list** into a min-heap.\n",
    "3. Use a **dummy node** to help build the merged result list.\n",
    "4. Repeatedly:\n",
    "   - Pop the smallest node from the heap.\n",
    "   - Append it to the result list.\n",
    "   - If the node has a `.next`, push it into the heap.\n",
    "5. Continue until the heap is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Heap for Efficient Sorting**:\n",
    "  - Always pulls the node with the smallest value in O(log k) time.\n",
    "- **ListNode Comparison**:\n",
    "  - Python requires us to define `__lt__` to compare custom objects in a heap.\n",
    "- **Dummy Node Technique**:\n",
    "  - Simplifies list construction and avoids edge cases.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(N log k)\n",
    "  - Where `N` is the total number of nodes, and `k` is the number of linked lists.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for the heap\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🔍 Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: lists = [\n",
    "  1 -> 4 -> 5,\n",
    "  1 -> 3 -> 4,\n",
    "  2 -> 6\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6"
