    "The problem evaluates the value of a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression. RPN is a postfix notation where every operator follows its operands, and there's no need for parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a stack (`track`) to keep track of intermediate results.\n",
    "- Iterate through the `tokens` list.\n",
    "- For each token:\n",
    "  - If itâ€™s an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), pop the last two numbers from the stack and perform the operation in **correct order** (`second operand` popped first).\n",
    "  - Push the result back onto the stack.\n",
    "  - If itâ€™s a number, convert it to `int` and push it onto the stack.\n",
    "- The final result will be the only element left in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm runs in O(n) time and uses O(n) space."

    "- **Stack Usage**: Ideal for problems with LIFO (last-in, first-out) behavior like RPN.\n",

    "- **Integer Division Behavior**:\n",
    "  - Use `int(b / a)` instead of `b // a` to ensure truncation toward zero (LeetCode requirement).\n",

    "  - Time: O(n), where n is the number of tokens.\n",
    "  - Space: O(n), for the stack in the worst case (all numbers, no operations)."
