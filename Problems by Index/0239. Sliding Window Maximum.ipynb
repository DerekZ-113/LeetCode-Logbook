    "### 239. Sliding Window Maximum â€“ Description & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to return the maximum value in every sliding window of size `k` as we move across the array from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **monotonic decreasing deque** (a double-ended queue) to efficiently track the maximum element in each window:\n",
    "- Each element in the deque stores the **index** of a number in `nums`.\n",
    "- The deque maintains a **decreasing order of values**, meaning the front of the deque always holds the index of the current maximum for the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **Iterate through each index `i`** in the input list `nums`.\n",
    "2. **Remove indices that are out of the current window** from the front of the deque.\n",
    "3. **Remove indices from the back of the deque** whose corresponding values are smaller than the current `nums[i]` â€” they will never be the max again.\n",
    "4. **Append the current index `i`** to the deque.\n",
    "5. **Append the max value** (`nums[q[0]]`) to the result list **once we have a full window**, i.e., when `i - k + 1 >= 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures we always have access to the current max in O(1) time, and the overall algorithm runs in O(n)."

    "- **Sliding Window Technique**: Moves a fixed-size window across the array to compute results on each segment.\n",
    "- **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Stores indices of elements in a way that supports efficient front and back operations.\n",
    "- **Monotonic Queue**: A deque maintained in decreasing order of values â€” ensures the maximum is always at the front.\n",
    "- **Window Validity Check**: We only start appending to the result list after `i >= k - 1` (i.e., the window is fully formed).\n",
    "- **Optimization Insight**: Instead of scanning each window to find the max (O(k)), we maintain max candidates dynamically for O(1) access.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”‘ By storing only **useful candidates** in the deque and discarding weaker ones, we optimize the brute-force approach from O(nk) to **O(n)** time."
