    "### 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Description\n",
    "Design a class to efficiently find the k-th largest element in a stream of integers. Implement a class `KthLargest` that maintains a running stream of integers and returns the k-th largest number each time a new number is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to:\n",
    "- Initialize the class with an integer `k` and a list of integers `nums`.\n",
    "- Implement the method `add(val: int)` that appends a new number to the stream and returns the k-th largest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Approach\n",
    "- Use a **min-heap** (priority queue) to keep track of the k largest elements seen so far.\n",
    "- During initialization:\n",
    "  - Convert `nums` into a heap.\n",
    "  - Trim the heap until it only has `k` elements — ensuring the smallest in the heap is the k-th largest element in the overall stream.\n",
    "- Each time `add(val)` is called:\n",
    "  - Push the new value into the heap.\n",
    "  - If the heap grows beyond `k` elements, pop the smallest.\n",
    "  - Return the root of the heap (`min_heap[0]`) which is always the k-th largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Min-Heap**: Efficiently maintains the k largest elements. The smallest of them (heap root) represents the k-th largest overall.\n",
    "- **Heap Invariant**: At any time, `min_heap` contains exactly `k` elements — the current top `k` largest elements.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Initialization: O(n log n) for heapify and trimming.\n",
    "  - Each `add`: O(log k) due to heap push and (optional) pop.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(k), storing only `k` elements in the heap."
