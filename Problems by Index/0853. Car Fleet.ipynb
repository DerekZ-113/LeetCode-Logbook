    "### ðŸš— Problem: Car Fleet\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given the `target` location and two arrays:\n",
    "- `position[i]`: the starting position of the i-th car\n",
    "- `speed[i]`: the speed of the i-th car\n",
    "\n",
    "All cars move toward the target. If a faster car catches up to a slower one, it forms a \"fleet\" and moves at the slower car's speed. Return the number of distinct fleets that will arrive at the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§  Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zip `position` and `speed`** into tuples, then **sort** by position in **descending** order. This way, we process cars from **closest to the target** to **farthest**.\n",
    "2. For each car, **calculate the time** it takes to reach the target:  \n",
    "   `time = (target - position) / speed`\n",
    "3. Use a **stack** to simulate fleets:\n",
    "   - If the stack is empty or the current time is **greater** than the top of the stack, the car canâ€™t catch up â†’ **new fleet**.\n",
    "   - If itâ€™s **less than or equal**, it **joins** the fleet ahead â†’ skip.\n",
    "4. The **length of the stack** at the end is the number of fleets."

    "- **Sorting** by position ensures we evaluate from front to back.\n",
    "- **Time to reach target** determines whether cars will catch up or not.\n",
    "- **Fleet behavior**:\n",
    "  - If a car takes **longer** to arrive, it **does not catch up** to the car ahead â€” new fleet.\n",
    "  - If it takes **less or equal time**, it **merges** into the existing fleet.\n",
