    "**Problem**:  \n",
    "You are given two integers `n` and `x`. Construct an increasing sequence of `n` integers where:\n",
    "- The first number is `x`.\n",
    "- Every number is **strictly greater** than the previous.\n",
    "- The **bitwise AND** of every two consecutive numbers is equal to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **last number** in this sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:  \n",
    "We build the sequence greedily using bit manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We're constructing a sequence that starts with `x` and satisfies the AND condition.\n",
    "2. Every next number must preserve the `1` bits of `x`, but we're free to flip 0s to 1s.\n",
    "3. So we:\n",
    "   - Record all bit positions in `x` that are **0** (we're allowed to flip these).\n",
    "   - Treat `k = n - 1` as a binary number to decide which 0-bit positions to flip.\n",
    "   - For each bit `i` in `k` that is `1`, we flip the corresponding 0-bit in `x` using OR.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constructs the `(n-1)`-th version of such modified sequences and gives the final result."

    "### ğŸ§© Key Concepts Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitmasking**: Use bitwise operators to analyze and modify bit patterns.\n",
    "- **Preserve `x`**: Every number in the sequence must have `x` as a subset of its bits (`num & x == x`).\n",
    "- **Mask Building**: Record indices of bits in `x` that are 0 (i.e., flexible bits).\n",
    "- **Binary Mapping**: Use `k = n - 1` as a bitmask to decide which 0-bit positions to flip.\n",
    "- **Bitwise OR `|=`**: Flip the bits based on `k`'s binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: `O(60)` â†’ constant time for all practical inputs.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: `O(60)` for storing bit positions (also constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clever bitmask construction problem. You're not building an actual array â€” just **simulating** the change needed to reach the `n`th version of a valid number."
