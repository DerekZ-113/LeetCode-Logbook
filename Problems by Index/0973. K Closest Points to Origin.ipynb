    "## 973. K Closest Points to Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Description\n",
    "Given an array of points on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two points is the **Euclidean distance**, but for comparison purposes, you only need the **squared distance** (no need to compute square root).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Approach\n",
    "- Use a **max heap** to keep track of the `k` closest points.\n",
    "- To simulate a max heap in Python (which only supports min heaps), store the **negated distance** as the first element in the heap.\n",
    "- Iterate through each point:\n",
    "  - Calculate the negative squared distance.\n",
    "  - Push the tuple `(distance, x, y)` into the heap.\n",
    "  - If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the farthest point (i.e., the one with the largest squared distance).\n",
    "- At the end, extract the `k` closest points from the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Heap**:\n",
    "  - Python's `heapq` module implements a min heap. By storing `-distance`, we simulate a max heap.\n",
    "- **Squared Distance**:\n",
    "  - Calculated as `x² + y²`. No need for `sqrt()` since we only care about relative distance.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**:\n",
    "  - Time Complexity: O(n log k), where n is the number of points.\n",
    "  - Space Complexity: O(k) for storing the heap of closest points.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🔍 Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance to origin:\n",
    "- [1,3] → 1² + 3² = 10\n",
    "- [-2,2] → (-2)² + 2² = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Closest point = [-2,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: [[-2,2]]"
