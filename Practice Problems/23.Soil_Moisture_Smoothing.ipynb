    "You are an agricultural scientist working on precision farming technology. You are given a two-dimensional matrix of integers **moistureGrid** representing soil moisture levels across a field, with `moistureGrid[i][j]` containing an integer from 0 to 255 to represent the moisture level of a soil cell at coordinate **(i, j)**. You are also given a non-negative integer parameter **smoothingRadius**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to apply a **moisture smoothing effect** to this field data.\n",

    "**To apply a moisture smoothing effect to the field:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the moisture level of each soil cell **(i, j)** with the **average value** of:\n",
    "- Its original moisture level `moistureGrid[i][j]`, AND\n",
    "- The mean moisture level of its neighboring cells (defined as `neighbors(i, j)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighbor definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil cell **(k, l)** is included in `neighbors(i, j)` if it satisfies the conditions:\n",
    "- `abs(i - k) <= smoothingRadius`\n",
    "- `abs(j - l) <= smoothingRadius`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "moistureGrid = [\n",
    "    [9, 6],\n",
    "    [3, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and `smoothingRadius = 1`, the output should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solution(moistureGrid, smoothingRadius) = [\n",
    "    [6, 5],\n",
    "    [4, 3]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- All soil cells in the original field have 3 neighbors.\n",
    "- `moistureGrid[0][0] = 9`, and its neighbors are `[6, 3, 0]` with a mean of...\n",
