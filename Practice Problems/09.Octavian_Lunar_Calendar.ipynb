    "## Problem: Octavian Lunar Calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 8/23/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "On the planet Octavia, astronomers track time using 8 distinct lunar phases instead of weekdays: \"NewMoon\", \"Crescent\", \"Quarter\", \"Gibbous\", \"Full\", \"Waning\", \"Eclipse\", and \"Twilight\". These phases repeat cyclically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Octavian year is divided into 12 seasons (identical to Earth months in length), and each date has a corresponding lunar phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**\n",
    "- A specific date (a season and day number)\n",
    "- The lunar phase with which the year began (January 1st)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Determine the lunar phase for that date.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Days in each season (non-leap year):**\n",
    "- January - 31, February - 28, March - 31, April - 30, May - 31, June - 30, July - 31, August - 31, September - 30, October - 31, November - 30, December - 31\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lunar phases in order:**\n",
    "- NewMoon, Crescent, Quarter, Gibbous, Full, Waning, Eclipse, Twilight (then repeats)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "**For** `season = \"January\"`, `dayCount = 4`, and `initialPhase = \"Full\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `\"Twilight\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "January 1-4 are Full, Waning, Eclipse, and Twilight, respectively. So, the answer is \"Twilight\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "**For** `season = \"February\"`, `dayCount = 4`, and `initialPhase = \"Crescent\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `\"Gibbous\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "February 4th is the 35th day since the beginning of the year. That is 4 full cycles (8 days each), and 3 more phases for the 5th cycle. So, given that the first day of the year is Crescent, the answer is Gibbous.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input/Output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `season` ∈ {\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"}\n",
    "- 1 ≤ dayCount ≤ 31\n",
    "- `initialPhase` ∈ {\"NewMoon\", \"Crescent\", \"Quarter\", \"Gibbous\", \"Full\", \"Waning\", \"Eclipse\", \"Twilight\"}\n",
    "- Execution time limit: 4 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **simple modular arithmetic problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate total days from Jan 1 to the given date\n",
    "2. Find position in 8-phase cycle\n",
    "3. Apply offset based on initial phase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "total_days = days_before_season + dayCount - 1  (subtract 1 because Jan 1 is day 0)\n",
    "phases_offset = (initial_phase_index + total_days) % 8\n",
    "return phases[phases_offset]\n",
    "```"
