    "## Problem: Lamps on Coordinate Line - Maximum Illumination\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 8/16/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "There are some lamps placed on a coordinate line. Each of these lamps illuminates some space around it within a given radius. You are given the coordinates of the lamps on the line, and the effective radius of each of the lamps' light.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format:**\n",
    "In other words, you are given a two-dimensional array `lamps`, where `lamps[i]` contains information about the i^th lamp:\n",
    "- `lamps[i][0]` is an integer representing the lamp's coordinate\n",
    "- `lamps[i][1]` is a positive integer representing the effective radius of the i^th lamp\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the i^th lamp illuminates everything in a range from `lamps[i][0] - lamps[i][1]` to `lamps[i][0] + lamps[i][1]` inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Your task is to find the coordinate of the point that is illuminated by the highest number of lamps. In case of a tie, return the point among them with the minimal possible coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `lamps = [[-2, 3], [2, 3], [2, 1]]`, the output should be `solution(lamps) = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram shows three lamps and their illumination ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first lamp illuminates everything in range `[-2 - 3, -2 + 3] = [-5, 1]`\n",
    "- The second lamp illuminates everything in range `[2 - 3, 2 + 3] = [-1, 5]`\n",
    "- The third lamp illuminates everything in range `[2 - 1, 2 + 1] = [1, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coverage visualization:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Position:  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n",
    "Coverage:   0   1   1   1   1   2   2   3   2   2   1   1   0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only point that is illuminated by all of the lamps is `1`, hence the answer is `1`."
