    "## Problem: Reconstruct Travel Journey from Photos\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 8/30/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "A traveler visited a series of unique landmarks on a journey. Unfortunately, their travel journal was damaged, and they can no longer remember the exact order of their visits. However, they do have a collection of photos, each showing exactly two landmarks that were visited consecutively (either landmark could have been visited first).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**\n",
    "The collection of photos represented as pairs of landmark IDs in `travelPhotos`, help the traveler reconstruct the complete journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key constraints:**\n",
    "- Each landmark was visited exactly once\n",
    "- For every consecutive pair of landmarks in the journey, there exists a photo containing both landmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may reconstruct the journey in either forward or reverse order - both are considered correct.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `travelPhotos = [[3, 5], [1, 4], [2, 4], [1, 5]]`,\n",
    "\n",
    "the output can be `solution(travelPhotos) = [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The photos show that landmarks 3 and 5 were visited consecutively, as were 1 and 4, 2 and 4, and 1 and 5.\n",
    "- By analyzing these connections, we can determine the traveler's journey was [3, 5, 1, 4, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **graph path reconstruction** problem! Specifically, it's finding an **Eulerian path** or **Hamiltonian path** depending on interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- Each photo is an edge between two landmarks (nodes)\n",
    "- We need to find a path that visits each landmark exactly once\n",
    "- This is essentially reconstructing a path through a graph where we know adjacent pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern:** This looks like **finding a path through a graph** where:\n",
    "- Nodes = landmarks\n",
    "- Edges = photos (consecutive pairs)\n",
    "- Goal = find path visiting each node once (Hamiltonian path)"
