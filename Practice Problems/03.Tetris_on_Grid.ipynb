    "## Problem: Drawing Tetris Pieces on Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 8/8/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "You have a sheet of n × m grid paper and you'd like to draw a cool design on it. You've decided on a block motif similar to tetris pieces. Specifically, your picture will include the following five types of figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 5 figure types (from the image):**\n",
    "- **A**: 1×1 square (single block)\n",
    "- **B**: 1×3 horizontal rectangle\n",
    "- **C**: 2×2 square\n",
    "- **D**: 1×2 horizontal rectangle\n",
    "- **E**: T-shape (or cross/plus shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "The array `figures` contains a list of letters representing the types of figures you'd like to include in your design. Your task is to create a matrix of integers representing the grid paper, and draw the figures on it according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a matrix of all `0`s, and use the **1-based index** of each figure to represent it on the grid. For example, if `figures[0] = 'E'` then the shape added to the grid will look like:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   [[0, 1, 0],\n",
    "    [1, 1, 1]]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Place the figures on the grid in the order they appear in `figures`. The figures must not overlap any other figures that have already been placed, and they may not be rotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Of all the available locations, choose the one with the **lowest row index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If there are multiple possible locations with the lowest row index, choose the one among them with the **lowest column index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It's guaranteed that all figures will fit on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return a matrix of integers representing the grid paper after all the figures have been drawn.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than O(n · m · figures.length) will fit within the execution time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `n = 4`, `m = 4`, and `figures = ['D', 'B', 'A', 'C']`, the output should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solution(n, m, figures) = [[1, 2, 2, 2],\n",
    "                           [1, 1, 3, 0],\n",
    "                           [1, 4, 4, 0],\n",
    "                           [0, 4, 4, 0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation (from visual):**\n",
    "- Figure 'D' (index 1) is placed first\n",
    "- Figure 'B' (index 2) is placed next  \n",
    "- Figure 'A' (index 3) is placed\n",
    "- Figure 'C' (index 4) is placed last"
