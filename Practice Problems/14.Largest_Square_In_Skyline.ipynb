    "## Problem: Largest Square in Skyline\n",

    "**Setup:**\n",
    "You are tasked with analyzing the potential space in a cityscape outlined by a series of skyscrapers. Each skyscraper's height is represented by an element in the array `cityLine`, where the width of each skyscraper is consistently `1`, and they are placed directly adjacent to each other along a road with no gaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Your mission is to determine the largest square area that can fit within this row of skyscrapers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `cityLine = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be `solution(cityLine) = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this configuration, there are several 2×2 squares that can be accommodated within the skyscrapers, but no larger square can fit owing to the limitations of their heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Grid showing 5 columns with heights 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "[A 2×2 square (highlighted in green) fits in the middle section]\n",

    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `cityLine = [4, 3, 4]`, the output should be `solution(cityLine) = 9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, a 3×3 square can fit snugly within the skyscraper setup, taking advantage of the uniform heights at the edges.\n",
