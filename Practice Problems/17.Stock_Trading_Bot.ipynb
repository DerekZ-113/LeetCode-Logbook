    "## Problem: Stock Trading Bot - Maximize Revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 9/17/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "You're creating a bot to handle stock trades for ONE stock. Each day, the bot either buys or sells one share.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**\n",
    "- `prices`: array of positive integers where `prices[i]` = stock price on day i\n",
    "- `algo`: array of 0s and 1s where:\n",
    "  - `algo[i] = 0` means **buy** on day i\n",
    "  - `algo[i] = 1` means **sell** on day i\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Choose a range of **k consecutive days** from `algo` to modify/override, such that it **maximizes total revenue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Revenue calculation:**\n",
    "- Revenue = sum of all selling prices - sum of all buying prices\n",
    "- Start with 0 revenue and enough shares to always sell when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Return the maximum possible revenue after optimally choosing which k consecutive days to override.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "prices = [2, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7]\n",
    "algo = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "k = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `21`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walkthrough of default algo (no override):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Day 0: algo[0]=0 → BUY at price 2  → revenue = 0 - 2 = -2\n",
    "Day 1: algo[1]=1 → SELL at price 4 → revenue = -2 + 4 = 2\n",
    "Day 2: algo[2]=0 → BUY at price 1  → revenue = 2 - 1 = 1\n",
    "Day 3: algo[3]=0 → BUY at price 5  → revenue = 1 - 5 = -4\n",
    "Day 4: algo[4]=1 → SELL at price 2 → revenue = -4 + 2 = -2\n",
    "Day 5: algo[5]=0 → BUY at price 6  → revenue = -2 - 6 = -8\n",
    "Day 6: algo[6]=0 → BUY at price 7  → revenue = -8 - 7 = -15\n",
    "\n",
    "Total revenue = -15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With optimal k=4 window override, we can get revenue = 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **sliding window + greedy optimization** problem. Key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We can override ANY k consecutive days** - so there are `n - k + 1` possible windows to try\n",
    "2. **Within the chosen window, we want the optimal strategy** - likely all sells at high prices, all buys at low prices\n",
    "3. **Outside the window, we follow the original algo**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part: What's the \"optimal\" strategy within the k-day window?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** \n",
    "- Within our k-day window, we want to **sell on high-price days** and **buy on low-price days**\n",
    "- But we're constrained by having to do one action per day\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me think about this more carefully...\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, I think the problem is asking: **choose k consecutive days where you can REWRITE the algo array optimally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the approach:\n",
    "1. Try all possible k-length windows `[i, i+k)`\n",
    "2. For each window, figure out the optimal buy/sell strategy for those k days\n",
    "3. Calculate total revenue: (before window) + (optimal window) + (after window)\n",
    "4. Return maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to think through what \"optimal strategy for k days\" means? Or should I walk you through it?"
