    "**Problem: Protein Folding Y-Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 10/11/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a molecular biologist working in a research laboratory that studies protein folding patterns. You have a square matrix representing a microscopic view of a protein structure, where each cell contains one of three possible molecular states: **0** (inactive), **1** (partially active), or **2** (fully active).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your research has identified a specific molecular pattern that indicates optimal protein stability - a **\"Y-shaped\" molecular pathway**. This pattern consists of two diagonal molecular chains extending from the upper corners down to the center, plus a vertical chain extending downward from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine the **minimum number of molecular state changes** required to transform the current protein matrix into one that exhibits this stable Y-pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Y-pattern is achieved when:**\n",
    "- All molecular states along the diagonals from the upper-left and upper-right corners down to the center are identical;\n",
    "- All molecular states along the vertical path from the center downward are identical to the diagonal states;\n",
    "- All other molecular states (the background) are identical to each other but different from the Y-pattern states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For a square matrix of size **n Ã— n**, there are exactly **6 possible Y-pattern configurations**. The Y-pattern states and background states can be any combination of the three molecular states (0, 1, 2) as long as they are different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "proteinMatrix = [\n",
    "    [1, 0, 2],\n",
    "    [1, 2, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 2, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the output should be `solution(proteinMatrix) = 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The optimal transformation is to change the **1** in the 0th row to **2** and the **1** in the 1st row to **0**.\n",
    "- **2**s form the Y-pattern molecular pathway and **0**s form the background.\n",
    "- The final matrix is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "proteinMatrix = [\n",
    "    [2, 0, 2],\n",
    "    [0, 2, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 2, 0]\n",

    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the output should be `solution(proteinMatrix) = 8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The **2**s here form the Y-pattern molecular pathway.\n",
    "- The optimal solution is to change all of the **0**s (total of 8) to **1**s to create a uniform background.\n",
    "- The final matrix is shown below:\n",
