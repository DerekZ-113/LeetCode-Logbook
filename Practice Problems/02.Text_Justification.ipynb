    "## Problem: Newspaper Text Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 8/6/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "You are emulating a newspaper page, and you have to align the text on the page properly. The text is provided to you in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- `paragraphs`: an array of paragraphs, where each paragraph is represented as an array of words\n",
    "- `aligns`: an array representing the alignment of each paragraph from `paragraphs` - each element is either `\"LEFT\"` or `\"RIGHT\"`\n",
    "- `width`: represents the maximum number of characters that can fit in the output per line\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to reproduce the newspaper page according to the following specifications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each paragraph `paragraphs[i]`, include all the words `paragraphs[i][j]` in order, separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Include as many words as possible per each page line (the length of the line must be less than or equal to `width`), and put the next word on a new line if it would exceed the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the case of left-aligned sentences, words from `paragraphs[i]` should be aligned according to `aligns[i]`. If `aligns[i] = \"LEFT\"`, the line should have trailing spaces; if `aligns[i] = \"RIGHT\"`, it should have leading spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Include a border of `*` characters around all the edges of the result - these characters don't count toward the width, they are just added to make output look pretty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return the resulting newspaper page as an array of strings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is guaranteed that it is possible to justify the given paragraphs to the newspaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than O(paragraphs.length · paragraphs[i].length · width) will fit within the execution time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `paragraphs = [[\"hello\", \"world\"], [\"How\", \"areYou\", \"doing\"], [\"Please look\", \"and align\", \"to right\"]]`, `aligns = [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\"]`, and `width = 16`, the output should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "solution(paragraphs, aligns, width) = [\n",
    "    \"******************\",\n",
    "    \"*hello world     *\",\n",
    "    \"*How areYou doing*\",\n",
    "    \"*    Please look*\",\n",
    "    \"*      and align*\",\n",
    "    \"*       to right*\",\n",
    "    \"******************\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation (partial, from what I can read):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `paragraphs[0] = [\"hello\", \"world\"]`: Both words fit on one line with a combined length of 11. Since `width = 16`, there are (16 - 11) = 5 excess spaces we'll need to add to the line. Since `aligns[0] = \"LEFT\"`, we align the text to the left by adding the excess spaces onto the right side of the line, so the first paragraph is the line `\"hello world     \"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `paragraphs[1] = [\"How\", \"areYou\", \"doing\"]`: All three words fit on one line with a length of 16. There are no excess spaces, so the result is `\"How areYou doing\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `paragraphs[2] = [\"Please look\", \"and align\", \"to right\"]`: The words \"Please look\" and \"and align\" are too long to combine (the result would have a length of 21 > 16), so we'll start a new line with \"and align\". Furthermore, the words \"and align\" and \"to right\" would have a combined length of 18 > 16 which is also too long, so \"to right\" will also be on a new line. Since `aligns[2] = \"RIGHT\"`, all excess spaces are added to the beginning of each line. Thus, the result of this paragraph is:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \"    Please look\"\n",
    "  \"      and align\"\n",
    "  \"       to right\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the border, we'll add an asterisk (`*` character) to the beginning and end of each line, and we'll also add a string of `width + 2` asterisks before the first paragraph and after the last paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input/Output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- 1 ≤ paragraphs.length ≤ 50\n",
    "- 1 ≤ paragraphs[i].length ≤ 10\n",
    "- 1 ≤ paragraphs[i][j].length ≤ width\n",
