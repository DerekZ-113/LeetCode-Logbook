    "## Problem: Secret Code Fragment Pairing\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 8/5/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "A spy agency has intercepted fragments of a secret code. Each fragment is represented as a positive integer in an array called `fragments`. The fragments need to be combined in a specific order to form the complete access code with a specific number called `accessCode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your mission is to determine how many different ways the fragments can be paired to form the complete access code.** The agency's cryptography experts state that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When fragments are combined, they are simply placed next to each other (not added mathematically)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each specific pair of fragments (by position in array) counts as a unique combination\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The fragments can be used in any order, but each fragment position can only be used once in a combination\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, if fragment \"12\" is followed by fragment \"34\", the result is \"1234\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "**For** `fragments = [1, 212, 12, 12]` and `accessCode = 1212`, the output should be `solution(fragments, accessCode) = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can form the access code `1212` by combining:\n",
    "- `fragments[0] = 1` with `fragments[1] = 212`\n",
    "- `fragments[2] = 12` with `fragments[3] = 12`\n",
    "- `fragments[3] = 12` with `fragments[2] = 12`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the last two combinations are considered different because they use different positions in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "**For** `fragments = [11, 11, 110]` and `accessCode = 11011`, the output should be `solution(fragments, accessCode) = 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can form the access code `11011` by combining:\n",
    "- `fragments[2] = 110` with `fragments[0] = 11`\n",
    "- `fragments[2] = 110` with `fragments[1] = 11`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that fragments do not need to be adjacent in the original array to be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "**For** `fragments = [777, 7, 777, 77, 77]` and `accessCode = 7777`, the output should be `solution(fragments, accessCode) = 6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can form the access code `7777` by combining:\n",
    "- `fragments[0] = 777` with `fragments[1] = 7`\n",
    "- `fragments[1] = 7` with `fragments[0] = 777`\n",
    "- `fragments[2] = 777` with `fragments[1] = 7`\n",
    "- `fragments[1] = 7` with `fragments[2] = 777`\n",
    "- `fragments[3] = 77` with `fragments[4] = 77`\n",
    "- `fragments[4] = 77` with `fragments[3] = 77`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that combinations using the same values but from different positions count separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Input/Output\n",

    "**Constraints:**\n",
