    "## Problem: Labyrinth Navigation with Teleports\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 9/19/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "You're exploring a rectangular labyrinth (n × m matrix) containing obstacles and teleports. Start at (0, 0), goal is to reach (n-1, m-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movement Rules:**\n",
    "1. **Always try RIGHT first**: From (row, col), try moving to (row, col+1)\n",
    "2. **If RIGHT blocked/invalid, try DOWN**: Move to (row+1, col)\n",
    "3. **If both blocked, STOP**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Mechanics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Obstacles:**\n",
    "- Cannot traverse through obstacles\n",
    "- If obstacle blocks your path, try the alternative direction\n",
    "- If both directions blocked, stop immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teleports:**\n",
    "- Represented as pairs: (start_cell, end_cell)\n",
    "- If you step on a `start` cell, you **immediately teleport** to the `end` cell\n",
    "- **One-way only**: Cannot teleport from `end` to `start`\n",
    "- Each cell has at most one teleport starting from it\n",
    "- The `end` cell of a teleport cannot be the `start` of another teleport\n",
    "- Both `start` and `end` cells do NOT contain obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Cells:**\n",
    "- Any cell without obstacle or teleport can be walked through normally\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Return the **total number of cells traveled** (including starting cell (0,0) and both start/end cells of teleports).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return:**\n",
    "- Total cell count if you reach (n-1, m-1)\n",
    "- `-1` if blocked by obstacle or out of bounds\n",
    "- `-2` if infinite teleport loop detected\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:** O(n · m · (obstacles.length + teleports.length)) is acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- `n = 3, m = 3`\n",
    "- `obstacles = [[2, 1]]`\n",
    "- `teleports = [[0, 1, 2, 0]]` (from (0,1) to (2,0))\n",
    "- Output: `-1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0,0] [0,1] [0,2]\n",
    "[1,0] [1,1] [1,2]\n",
    "[2,0]  X    [2,2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **simulation problem** - you're literally following the stated algorithm step by step. The tricky parts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Teleport detection** - need fast lookup for \"is this cell a teleport start?\"\n",
    "2. **Cycle detection** - infinite teleport loops\n",
    "3. **Following the priority** - right first, then down, then stop\n",
    "\n",
    "This screams for a **state-based simulation** where we track position and visited states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to talk through the approach, or take a crack at it first?"
