    "## Problem: Data Transmission Segments - Unique Bytes Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 9/10/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "A team of astronauts on a spaceship is receiving important data from Earth for their research. The data is being transmitted in segments that contain specific parts of the file, and each segment defines a byte range in the form of a two-dimensional array `segments`. For each segment `segments[i]`, the range is given as an array of two 64-bit integers: `segments[i][0]` is the index of the first byte in the i^th segment, and `segments[i][1]` is the index of the last byte in the i^th segment (both indices are inclusive, 1-based).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Your task is to calculate the total number of unique bytes received for the entire file after each segment is received. Keep in mind that segments can overlap with or completely replicate previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `segments = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]`, the output should be `solution(segments) = [1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first segment only contains the byte `1`, so the total number of unique bytes received becomes `1` after this segment.\n",
    "- The second segment only contains the byte `2`, so the total becomes `2` after this segment.\n",
    "- The third segment only contains the byte `3`, making the total `3` after this segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `segments = [[1, 9], [1, 3], [8, 15], [6, 9], [2, 5]]`, the output should be `solution(segments) = [9, 9, 15, 15, 15]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first segment contains bytes `1` to `9`, so the total is `9`.\n",
    "- The second segment doesn't add new data, keeping the total at `9`.\n",
    "- The third segment adds bytes up to `15`, increasing the total to `15`.\n",
    "- The remaining segments do not change the total as these bytes have already been received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual representation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bytes:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15\n",

    "segments[0] = [1,1]\n",
    "segments[1] = [2,2]\n",
    "segments[2] = [3,3]\n",
