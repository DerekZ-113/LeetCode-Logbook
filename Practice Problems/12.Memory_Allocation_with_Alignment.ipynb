    "## Problem: Memory Allocation with Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "You are given an array of integers `memory` consisting of `0`s and `1`s which indicates whether the corresponding memory unit is free or not. `memory[i] = 0` means that the i^th memory unit is free, and `memory[i] = 1` means it's occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory is aligned with segments of `8` units so all occupied memory blocks must start at an index divisible by `8` (e.g. `0`, `8`, `16`, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to perform two types of queries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Type 1: `alloc x`\n",
    "Find the left-most **aligned** memory block of `x` consecutive free memory units and mark these units as occupied (ie: find the left-most contiguous subarray of `0`s, starting at the position `start` which is divisible by `8`, and replace all these memory units with `1`s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there is no proper aligned memory block with `x` consecutive free units, return `-1`\n",
    "- Otherwise return the index of the first position of the allocated block segment and assign an `ID` to every single element in the block, based on an **atomic counter** (the counter starts at `1` and is incremented on every successful alloc operation).\n",
    "- **Note:** `x` may be greater than `8`, so the block may cover more than one memory segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Type 2: `erase ID`\n",
    "If there exists an allocated memory block with element IDs equal to `ID`, free all its memory units (set all of the bits in the block to `0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return the length of the deleted memory block. If there is no such `ID` or the block with this `ID` has already been deleted, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The queries are given in the following format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `queries` is an array of 2-element arrays\n",
    "- If `queries[i][0] = 0` then this is an `alloc` type query, where `x = queries[i][1]`\n",
    "- If `queries[i][0] = 1` then this is an `erase` type query, where `ID = queries[i][1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return an array containing the results of all the queries.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than O(queries.length · memory.length²) will fit within the execution time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**For** `memory = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and \n",
    "\n",
    "`queries = [[0, 2], [0, 1], [0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 3], [1, 4], [0, 4]]`,\n",
    "\n",
    "the output should be `solution(memory, queries) = [8, 0, -1, 2, 8, -1, -1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[0, 2]` corresponds to `alloc 2`, which allocates a memory block from units `8` to `9`, as `8` is the first aligned position with 2 free slots. `ID = 1` is also assigned to this segment. After this operation `memory = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Return the memory block starting index, `8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[0, 1]` corresponds to `alloc 1`, which allocates a memory block from units `0` to `0`. After this operation, `memory = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. `ID = 2` is also assigned to this segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[0, 1]` corresponds to `alloc 1`. There is no memory block of length `1` with start position divisible by `8`, so return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[1, 1]` corresponds to `erase 1`. The range with `ID = 1` is `[8, 9]` (pair of the 8^th and 9^th elements). After freeing the... (text cuts off)"
