## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:

```python
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert2-tree.jpg)
```python
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

Example 3:
```python
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints: \
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]. \
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach: Recursion
To invert the binary tree, we need to swap each node's left and right child. The key is to choose a traversal method and perform the swap. 

### 1. Determine base case
- Start at root node. If the root node is None, return None.
### 2. Traversal order
- Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traveral all applicable to this problem. The solution code will be using the pre-order traveral.
1. Swap the left and right nodes
2. Recurse to the left child
3. Recurse to the right child

### 3. Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n). Each node needs to be visited once
- Space complexity: O(h). h is the height of the tree.

### 4. Code
```python
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None

        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left

        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)

        return root
```
