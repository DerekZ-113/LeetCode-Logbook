## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1: \
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)
```python
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
```python
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```
 

Constraints: \
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. \
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach: DFS
Use depth first search to recursively call the function to calculate the max depth of the left and right subtrees.

### 1. Determine base case
- Start at root node. If the root node is None, return None.
### 2. Recursively call on left and right subtrees

### 3. Return
- get the max between left and right subtree
- plus one to adding the current level

### 3. Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n). Each node needs to be visited once
- Space complexity: O(h). h is the height of the tree.

### 4. Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return None

        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)

        return 1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)
```
